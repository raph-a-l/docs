## Objective

With the Cloud Databases database servers, you can influence your server’s global settings. You can also view your server's activity. 

**Find out how to configure and optimise your database server.**

## Requirements

- a [Cloud Database](https://www.ovh.co.uk/cloud-databases/){.external}
- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB){.external}

## Instructions

### View general information on your database server

In the services bar on the left-hand side of your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB){.external}, go to the `Databases`{.action} section, then select the SQL instance concerned. Click on the `General information`{.action} tab.

You can also view important information on your SQL instance. Please take a few moments to ensure that the information displayed is correct, and corresponds to the instructions below.

|Information|Details|
|---|---|
|Service status|Mainly shows if the instance has been rebooted, is in the process of rebooting, or is suspended. Your instance must be rebooted if you need to carry out any actions. |
|Type|Shows the database system used by the server. If you are unsure if the correct type is being used, please note that the most common version is “MySQL”, but other types also exist (PostgreSQL, MariaDB). For example, if you are using WordPress for your website, a MySQL system is perfect for it.|
|Version|Shows the database system version used by the server. Check that your website is compatible with the version you have chosen.|
|RAM|Shows the RAM available for your instance, also shows if you are close to exceeding the RAM limit. Your database server has dedicated, guaranteed resources: its RAM. If required, you can scale the RAM, and receive warnings if you are consuming all of your instance’s RAM resources.|
|Infrastructure|Shows the infrastructure used by your instance. This information is inherent to the OVHcloud infrastructure.|
|Datacentre|Shows the datacentre in which the instance has been created. Verify that your instance is hosted in is the same datacentre as the OVHcloud Web Hosting plan that your website is based (or will be based) on.|
|Host|Shows the OVHcloud server your instance has been created in. This information is inherent to the OVHcloud infrastructure, and can be used in our communications on [OVHcloud incidents](https://web-cloud.status-ovhcloud.com/){.external}.|

### Authorising an IP address (only on Cloud Database solutions)

In order for your CloudDB instance to be accessible, you must enter the IP addresses or ranges that can connect to your database.

In the services bar on the left-hand side of your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB), go to the `Databases`{.action} section, then select the SQL instance concerned. Click on the `General information`{.action} tab.

To do this, click on the `Authorised IPs`{.action} tab, then click `Add an IP address/mask`{.action}.

![clouddb](images/clouddb-add-ip.png){.thumbnail}

In the window that pops up, enter the IP address or mask that you wish to authorise `IP/mask`{.action}, together with a description, if you wish. You can then decide if you want to grant access to the databases only, or to the SFTP as well. Finally, click `Confirm`{.action}.

![clouddb](images/clouddb-add-ip-step2.png){.thumbnail}

#### Authorise connections to OVHcloud Web Hosting plans 

For an OVHcloud Web Hosting plan, you will need to authorise its gateway IP address. 

To find the **gateway IP address** go to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB){.external}. Click the `Web Cloud` tab, then click on `Hosting plans`{.action} in the left column. Select your Web Hosting plan in the list, then click on the `FTP - SSH` tab.

Here, look for **FTP server**, which will show you the cluster number you are on, as shown below.

![clouddb](images/clouddb-add-ip-step3.png){.thumbnail}

Once you have retrieved the number of the cluster on which your Web Hosting plan is located, go to the [IP address list for Web Hosting clusters](../list-of-ip-addresses-of-web-hosting-clusters/). It provides the gateway IP address for each cluster.

> [!warning]
>
> The cluster IP address will not work to authorise the connection to the Cloud DB server. Please add the gateway IP address.
>


### Modifying the database server solution

To modify the solution for your database server, go to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB){.external}. Click the `Web Cloud` tab, and then click `Database`{.action} in the left pane. Select the name of your database server.

In the **General information** tab, displayed by default, click on `...`{.action} to the right of “RAM”, then on `Change the amount of RAM`{.action} to access the order for this modification.

![clouddb](images/private-sql-order-ram01.png){.thumbnail}

Choose the amount of RAM you want, then click `Next`{.action}. You can then choose the duration you want.

> [!primary]
>
> The remaining term until expiration will be prorated.
> This pro rata calculation will be based on the expiration date of the CloudDB server, not on the date of the purchase order.
> 

Once you have confirmed your contracts, you will be redirected to the purchase order to pay for this change. It will then be effective within a few hours.

> [!warning]
>
>  If you currently have a free CloudDB server available as part of a Performance hosting, it will no longer be free after changing your offer.

> [!primary]
> When you encounter an error on your website stating "**Too many connections**", this is due to the number of simultaneous connections on your database server being exceeded.
> You can then increase the **MaxConnections variable** if it is not at its maximum.
>

> [!primary]
>
> <b>Tmpdir</b>:  
> \- /dev/shm: The database server will allocate half of its RAM to this directory for higher performance.
>
> \- /tmp: The server will allocate unlimited space on its hard disk for this directory, but this will be much less efficient. We recommend using this directory only for occasional heavy operations.
>

> [!primary]
>
> sql_mode :
> - NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER : Default mode of MariaDB 10.1.
> - STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION : Default mode of MariaDB 10.2 and higher.
>
> We recommend always using the default mode, unless your database was updated from a version with a default mode that is different from the current version.
>

Make the necessary changes, then click `Confirm`{.action}.

> [!warning]
>
> Any changes require a restart of the database server.

### Logs and metrics

#### Query runtime statistics

This allows you to view the query execution time on your database server in the last 24 hours.

In your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB), go to the `Web Cloud` section, and then click `Databases`{.action} in the left pane. Select the name of your CloudDB server.

Go to the `Metrics` tab for your database server. You will find the graph **Query Execution Time Statistics**.

![clouddb](images/private-sql-metrics01.png){.thumbnail}

#### Access to Slow Query logs

> **Definition of slow query log**
> 
> These are the queries that take longer to run. The value is set to 1 second on our database servers in the variable **“long_query_time”**.

These logs, labelled **"slow-query.log"**, can be retrieved from the root of the SFTP space of your database server. 


In your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB), go to the `Web Cloud` section, and then click `Databases`{.action} in the left pane. Select the name of your CloudDB server.

In the `General information` tab, you will find the **SFTP** section in the **Connection information** box.

![clouddb](images/private-sql-SFTP01.png){.thumbnail}

To log in via **SFTP**, you can do so via the FileZilla software, using [this guide](../web_hosting_filezilla_user_guide/).

If this file is empty, you do not have any slow queries.


#### Monitoring the RAM used

In your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB), go to the `Web Cloud` section, and then click `Databases`{.action} in the left pane. Select the name of your CloudDB server.

Go to the `Metrics` tab in the OVHcloud Control Panel. You will find the graph **RAM usage statistics**.

![clouddb](images/private-sql-metrics02.png){.thumbnail}

#### Number of connections per minute

This graph allows you to track, over the last 24 hours, the load of connections per minute on your database server.

In your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB), go to the `Web Cloud` section, and then click `Databases`{.action} in the left pane. Select the name of your CloudDB server.

Go to the `Metrics` tab in the OVHcloud Control Panel. You will find the graph **Statistics for total connections per minute**.

### Managing your databases

It is recommended that you maintain your database to ensure high performance. Performance refers to the fact that the information contained in the database is most quickly returned to the script that requests it. This requires a structured and optimised database.

#### Indexing a database

To increase the speed of searches during a query, you must index the fields that are used in WHERE clauses.

Example: you do a regular search for people in relation to the city. Index the “city” field with the following query:

```bash
ALTER TABLE 'test' ADD INDEX ('city')
```

#### Purging a database

Some of your data is no longer being accessed? By archiving it, your tables will be less crowded and searches will go faster.

#### Display limit

Limit the display of records to a fixed number (for example: 10 per page) with the **"LIMIT"** portion of your SQL query.

#### Query grouping

Group your queries at the beginning of the script this way:

```bash
open_connection
request1
request2
...
close_connection

Display...
Treat data
Loop through data...
Display...
...
```

#### Retrieve only useful data

In your SQL queries, make sure you select only what you need, and especially that you have not forgotten the links between the tables.

Example:

```bash
(where table1.champs = table2.champs2)
```

#### Avoid options that consume too many resources

Avoid using **"HAVING"** for example. It increases your requests. Similarly, avoid using **“GROUP BY”**, unless it is strictly necessary.
